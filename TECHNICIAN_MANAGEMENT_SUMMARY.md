## 🚀 Next Steps (You Need to Do This)

Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Your Project → Firestore Database → Indexes

**Create Index 1:**
- Collection: `users`
- Fields:
  - `role` (Ascending)
  - `applicationDate` (Descending)

**Create Index 2:**
- Collection: `users`
- Fields:
  - `role` (Ascending)

Click "Create" for each and wait for them to build (~2-5 minutes).
