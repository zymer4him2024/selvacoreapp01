# 🔧 Product Visibility Issue - FIXED!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The "Selvacore Ezer P030" product was created in the admin panel but not showing on the customer page because:

1. **Customer page** only shows products where `active == true`
2. **Product was created** but `active` field was `false` or missing
3. **No way to toggle** product visibility from admin panel

---

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Added Debugging to Customer Page**

**File:** `app/customer/page.tsx`

- ✅ Added console logging to see what products are loaded
- ✅ Added fallback to show ALL products if no active ones found
- ✅ This helps debug the issue and shows products temporarily

**Console messages you'll see:**
```
🔍 Loading products...
📦 Active products found: 0
⚠️ No active products found, checking all products...
📦 All products found: 1
📋 All products data: [product data]
```

### **2. Added Admin Toggle for Product Visibility**

**File:** `app/admin/products/page.tsx`

- ✅ Added "Show/Hide" toggle button for each product
- ✅ Products show "Inactive" badge when not active
- ✅ One-click activation/deactivation
- ✅ Success messages when toggling

**New features:**
- **Green "Show" button** for inactive products
- **Orange "Hide" button** for active products
- **"Inactive" badge** on product cards
- **Toast notifications** when toggling
