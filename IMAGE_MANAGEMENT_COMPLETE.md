3. System validates each file (type, size)
4. Images are optimized (compressed, resized)
5. Files uploaded to Firebase Storage
6. Product document updated with new image URLs
7. UI updates immediately with new images

### Delete Flow:
1. Admin clicks delete button on image
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Image removed from product document
4. File deleted from Firebase Storage
5. UI updates to remove image

### Reorder Flow:
1. Admin drags an image to new position
2. UI updates immediately (optimistic)
3. New order saved to Firestore
4. If error occurs, order reverts automatically

### Set Primary Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Set Primary" on any image
2. Image moves to first position
3. Order updated in Firestore
4. Success toast notification

## 📱 Customer-Side Reflection

All changes made in the admin console **automatically reflect** across:
- ✅ Customer home page (product cards)
- ✅ Product detail pages (main image + thumbnails)
- ✅ Order history (product snapshots)
- ✅ Payment pages (product images)

**No additional code needed** - changes are immediate because all pages fetch from the same Firestore product documents.
