# 🎯 App Restructure - Clean Separation COMPLETE!

## ✅ **What Was Done:**

### **1. Simplified URL Structure**

**Before:**
```
/                           → Language selection
/login                      → Customer/Technician login
/admin-login                → Admin login (separate page)
/select-role                → Role selection
```

**After:**
```
/                           → Auto-redirect to /login or dashboard
/login                      → Customer/Technician (language selection + login)
/admin                      → Admin login portal
/admin/*                    → Admin dashboard and management
```
