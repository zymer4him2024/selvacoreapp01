## 🔧 **Important Notes:**

### **Why Vercel, Not Firebase Hosting?**

Your app uses:
- Dynamic routes (e.g., `/admin/products/[id]`)
- Server-side features
- Real-time authentication

Firebase Hosting only serves static files (HTML/CSS/JS), so it cannot run your Next.js app.

**Vercel** provides the Node.js server needed for your app features.

## 🌐 **About `selvacoreapp01.web.app`:**

**Firebase `.web.app` domains:**
- Cannot be pointed to Vercel
- Only work with Firebase Hosting static files
- Are managed by Google/Firebase

**To use a custom domain:**
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `selvacoreapp.com`)
2. Add it to Vercel
3. Update DNS records

**Or just use:** `selvacoreapp01.vercel.app` (free, professional, works great!)

---

## ⚠️ **Manual Steps Still Needed:**

### **1. Update Firestore Rules**

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/selvacoreapp01/firestore/rules

Copy content from `firestore.rules` file and publish.

**Why:** Allows customers to read products and place orders.
