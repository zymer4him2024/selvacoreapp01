- `/lib/services/technicianAdminService.ts` - Admin service functions

### Technician Application

### Components

### Configuration
- Updated `/firestore.indexes.json` - Added composite indexes for technician queries
- Updated `/firestore.rules` - Already supports technician management

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Indexes

You need to manually create the following composite indexes in Firebase Console:

#### Index 1: Users by Role and Application Date
```
Collection: users
Fields:
  - role (Ascending)
  - applicationDate (Descending)
```

#### Index 2: Users by Role, Status, and Application Date
```
Collection: users
Fields:
  - role (Ascending)
  - technicianStatus (Ascending)
  - applicationDate (Descending)
```

**How to create indexes:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `selvacoreapp01`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Indexes** tab
4. Click **Create Index**
5. Add each field with the specified order
6. Click **Create**
7. Wait for index to build (usually 1-5 minutes)

> **Note**: The existing Firestore rules already support technician operations, so no rule updates are needed!

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add technician management system"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy your changes.

   - Service areas (add at least 1)
   - Certifications (optional)
   - Professional bio (minimum 50 characters)
5. Submit application
6. You should see: "Application Under Review" page

#### B. Test Admin Approval Flow

1. Sign in as **admin**
2. Navigate to **Technicians** in the sidebar
3. You should see the pending application in the **Pending** tab
4. Click on the technician card to view details
5. Test the following actions:
   - **Approve** the technician

   - Edit service areas and certifications
   - Add admin notes

#### C. Test Technician Job Flow

1. Sign in as the **newly approved technician**
2. Navigate to the technician dashboard
