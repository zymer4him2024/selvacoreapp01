## 💡 Notes

### **Firestore Warnings**
The Firestore connection warnings are normal until you:
1. Create the database in Firebase Console
2. Deploy the security rules

Once done, warnings will disappear!

### **Fake Payment**
Currently using fake payment service.
To switch to real payment, just replace:
```typescript
import { processFakePayment } from '@/lib/services/fakePaymentService';
// with
import { processRealPayment } from '@/lib/services/amazonPayService';
```

### **Image Uploads**
Firebase Storage is configured but needs Storage rules deployed.
Rules file needed: `storage.rules`
