# Image Cropping Fix - Complete

## ✅ Problem Solved

Images were being **cropped** when displayed in containers because they were using `object-cover` CSS class, which fills the container by cropping parts of the image.

## 🎯 Solution Applied

Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` with proper container backgrounds:

### Before
```css
className="w-full h-40 object-cover rounded-apple"
```
❌ Images get cropped to fill the container

### After
```css
<div className="w-full h-40 bg-surface-elevated rounded-apple overflow-hidden">
  <img className="w-full h-full object-contain" />
</div>
```
✅ Images fit properly without cropping
✅ Containers have subtle backgrounds

## 🔧 Technical Details

### CSS Classes Used

**Container Wrapper:**
```css
<div className="w-full h-40 bg-surface-elevated rounded-apple overflow-hidden">
```

**Image Element:**
```css
<img className="w-full h-full object-contain" />
```

### Why This Works

1. **`object-contain`** - Fits the image within the container without cropping
2. **`bg-surface-elevated`** - Provides subtle background so images don't look lost in space
3. **`overflow-hidden`** - Ensures rounded corners work properly
4. **Fixed heights** - Maintains consistent layout (h-40, h-48, h-80, h-96)
