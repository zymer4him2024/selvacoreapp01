- You'll see the deployment status
- Wait for "✓ Ready" (usually 2-3 minutes)
- Refresh the page if needed

## 🔧 **Important: Check Firebase Domains**

I've opened **Firebase Console** for you:

1. Scroll down to **"Authorized domains"** section
2. **Make sure these 3 domains are listed:**
   - ✅ `localhost` (for local development)
   - ✅ `selvacoreapp01.firebaseapp.com` (Firebase default)
   - ✅ `selvacoreapp01.vercel.app` ← **MUST HAVE THIS!**

3. **If `selvacoreapp01.vercel.app` is missing:**
   - Click **"Add domain"**
   - Enter: `selvacoreapp01.vercel.app`
   - Click **"Add"**
